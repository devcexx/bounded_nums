# bounded_nums

This crate defines multiple types, traits and operators
implementations for working with bounded numbers, which allows to
define refined number types whose possible values are assured to be
present inside a specific numeric range in compile time. 

**This crate uses experimental and incompleted compiler functions such
as `const_generics` feature. Therefore, nightly compiler builds are
required, and no stability is guaranteed**.

For more information, see the [crate documentation](src/lib.rs) (or
better, compile it with `cargo doc`).
